		Making sure that your bunny is well fed and that it's on the right diet is one of the most important things you can do for your bunny. What they should be eating and how much varies depending on the size and age of the bunny. This means this page won't be accurate for every bunny, but you can adapt the answer for your bunny's needs.

		What should you feed your bunny?
		<p>
			 The most important thing is to have an unlimited supply of hay always around, and it should be oat or timothy hay. You should also feed them a cup of greens (parsley or cilantro) for every 3lb your bunny weighs. And you should give your bunny 1/8-1/4 cup of pellets for every 5lb your bunny weighs. These should be feed greens in the morning, pellets in the evening or vice versa.
		</p>
		What is a bunny's diet made of?
	
		<p>
			A bunny's diet usually consists of 80% hay, 10% veggies, 5% healthy pellets, and 5% healthy treats.
		</p>
		What treats should you feed your bunny?
		<p>
		Remember, treats should only be given rarely or not too often because they can be unhealthy for them if given too much. You can give your bunny a slice of banana, apple, pineapple, watermelon, or carrot. Grapes are also a good option.
		</p>
	
		What brands are the best for bunny food?	
		<p>
			The best brands to look out for are; Oxbow for hay and pellets and Small Pet Select for timothy hay.
